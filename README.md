# Omni-directional-Robot-Collision-Awareness
FURP 2024 Summer

Omni-directional robot refers to those robots that can move freely within a plane, and can move in any direction or angle without turning. The feature of these robots is that their wheels or drive systems are designed to allow the robot to move forward, backward, sideways, diagonally or even rotate.

Omni-directional robots usually use special omni-wheels, Mecanum wheels, or Steering Wheels. These wheels have multiple rollers, installed around the wheel, allowing the wheel to roll independently in different directions. By precisely controlling the speed and direction of each wheel, omni-directional robots can achieve extremely flexible movement.

Omni-directional robots are very useful in many fields, such as industrial automation, warehouse logistics, service robots, robot football matches, and other scenes. This type of robot can effectively move and position in crowded or restricted spaces, improving the efficiency and flexibility of operations.

This summer research activity aims to explore the underlying control of mobile robots, simultaneous mapping and positioning, and navigation and trajectory planning tasks.
